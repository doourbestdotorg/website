# Exiled Overseas, Open Source Website Code, Making a Living

Having endured persecution from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), I have been in exile overseas for over seven months now. During this time, I've had no income whatsoever, and I'm currently struggling to make ends meet. Additionally, I'm unable to contact friends and family in China for fear of putting them in danger.

Although I've live in a foreign country, it's not a Western democracy, and my personal safety is still under serious threat.

Originally, I was a software engineer, and if I focused solely on technology, my life might be easier. However, I have an inherent spirit of resistance, and now I find myself in direct opposition to the CCP.

While I don't wish to continue working in technology, I am fully committed to resisting the authoritarian rule of the CCP. However, survival is currently my top priority.

Recently, I've developed a personal website program and made it open source on GitHub, where anyone can freely download and use it.

Each of us can register accounts on social platforms and post information. However, if an account is banned or deleted, all content will disappear. Having one's own website allows for content synchronization, ensuring that even if an account is banned, the content remains intact. This is one of the main reasons I've open sourced the code.

The website code is fully open source, allowing anyone to inspect its security. Security is paramount. Developed using the Python Flask framework, it's easy to maintain, free to download, and free to use.

The open source code does not include update detection functionality. This is because it requires read, write, and execute permissions on the user's server, which could pose security threats to the user's server and website.

I recommend users purchase their own domain and server, which costs around $70 to $80 per year. This allows for the deployment of scheduled automatic tweeting functions, keeping resources in the users' hands, which is the safest approach.

If users require server configuration and maintenance, the fee is $100 (excluding a dedicated server), with program issues being maintained free of charge, with payment required upfront. Please provide complete requirements and contact via the email below.

The website code can also be hosted on my server, but it does not support scheduled automatic posting to avoid multiple accounts being pushed from the same IP, reducing permissions, or being blocked.

Free maintenance only covers code error issues. Requests for adding features or modifying page styles are not included in the free maintenance scope.

Any new feature updates will be provided for free with the user's consent.

Changes made in the backend settings or navigation menus will take effect immediately on the backend page. However, the frontend page will require a browser restart to take effect, aimed at improving website performance.

For any personalized requirements, basic page style adjustments can be made. Please send specific requirements to the email provided.

Website security is comprehensive, including but not limited to servers, databases, code, and permissions. Users deploying it themselves must ensure minimum authorization in all aspects.

The website currently supports English, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese (both traditional and simplified).

I look forward to receiving valuable feedback and suggestions from users via email or GitHub regarding any desired additional features.
